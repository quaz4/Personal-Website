                IT support at Scotch College in Perth. I help Staff and Students with any IT device or service provided by the school, liaising with higher level technical staff if required. I also spend a lot of time documenting processes at the school, writing documents for both IT staff and the general community, adjusting my language accordingly.

                Working remotely, I built an exchange from the ground up using Angular 6 for the front-end and backend using typescript and node.js. The backend consisted of user account management, a crypto payments system I built and a matching engine for resolving the trades.

                I also built an ICO platform using ejs, UIKit and node.

                After working on a university based project with Progressive Medical, I was given the opportunity to come and work on commercial products with the team. I gained experience using the ionic framework as well as databases and backend services written in node and PHP.

              I built No-eu for a bit of practice with building custom express middleware. It basically redirects all requests originating from countries in the EU to a page you specify. I had the idea around the time GDPR was in the news and some companies said they would just block all EU traffic instead of attempting to comply, so I thought it could be a fun challenge. It's all open source and open for anyone to use through NPM.

                Yaft is an app I created to fill a gap in the workout management tools available. It was designed to be similar to trello lists and make planning a workout simple.

                I built it using the Ionic 3 framework, using Typescript, HTML and CSS.
